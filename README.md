# FRC3620_2019_Doug_TrainingRobot
Base Robot Programming Training Notes.

Here we are going to discuss the following topics for starters 
 
* Java Basic Programming
* Github to manage code repositary 
* Visio Studio Code for code implementation/compiling/debugging/downloading
* Robot Libraries to access the devices to drive 
* Basic Example to drive Robot
* Online Help Links

# Java Basic Programming
  Before working on Robot, developers shall required some skills on Java programming to able to drive the Robot through programming.
  Here are few topics we are going to cover on Java:
  * Data Types 
  * Statements
  * Conditions
  * loops
  * Functions with arguments and returns
  * Classes
  * Class Member functions
  * Class Member Variables
  * Public, Protected, Private
  * Import 
  * Main function
  * new 
  * override
  * extends
  * constructor and destructor
  * static variable 
  * static function
  * enums
  * constants
  * How to access Java functions
  * How to define a user required Class
  * How to define a user required Class to extend existing predefined classes
  * Java file creations
  * Java Sample example
  * Compile, Debugging, Downloading and execution
